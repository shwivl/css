<div> - groups content
<section> - groups related content
<article> - groups independent, self-contained content

headeris meant for use in the bodytag of your HTML document.
This is different than the headelement, which contains the page's title, meta information, etc.

The audiotag supports the controls attribute.
This shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls, and supports keyboard functionality.
This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, its presence on the tag turns the setting on.

Here's an example:

<audio id="meowClip" controls>
  <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
  <source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
</audio>


ADD THE FOLLOWING TO SEPARATE FILES

----------
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Real Coding Ninjas</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p><audio controls>
      <source src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/screen-reader.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />
      </audio> 
      A sound clip of Zersiax's screen reader in action.</p>
    
    
    
  </main>
</body>
----------
THIS IS USED TO DEMONSTRATE THE USEFULNESS OF A FOR ATTRIBUTE FOR SCREEN READERS
